How to deploy and build pslot
=============================

You need to get a linux kernel source code and extract it inside ```linux``` repertory. After, just go to this repertory and build the kernel normally. (It will be better, to make a symlink with ```/usr/src/linux```, this depends of your distribution).

Go to ```pslot``` directory, and build it.

Enjoy !
